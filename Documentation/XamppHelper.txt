    Accessing the Xampp GUI
        > cd /opt/lampp
        * Run one of two commands, depending on your install. EITHER:
            > sudo ./manager-linux.run
            OR
            > sudo ./manager-linux-x64.run

    Changing Xampp root directory
        * Open Xampp GUI

        * Select "Apache Web Server" and click "Configure"
        * Click "Open Conf File"
        * Scroll down until you find the following two lines (about halfway)
            DocumentRoot "/opt/lampp/htdocs"
            <Directory "/opt/lampp/htdocs">
        * Change these two lines to your current project directory. IE:
            DocumentRoot "/home/*UserNameHere*/Projects/CS3500/"
            <Directory "/home/*UserNameHere*/Projects/CS3500/">
        * Save file and exit back to the Xampp GUI Servers window.
        * Attempt to start/restart "Apache Web Server" (changes will not take place unless server is turned off and back on)
