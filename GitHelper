Installation:

Windows:
    Installer: https://git-scm.com/download/win

    * Run Installer.
    * Default components are fine.
    * Select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" if you want to be able to use git with the cmd terminal.
      Otherwise, select "Use Git from Git Bash only" if you want to only have access to git from the git terminal.
    * Defaults are fine for rest of install process.

Linux:
    > sudo apt install git

General:

    Setup basic git configuration on new machine:
        > git config --global user.name 'your name'
        > git config --global user.email 'your email'
        > git config --global core.editor 'PreferedTextEditor'
          Note: Standard for windows is 'notepad'. For linux is 'nano'.
        > git config --global push.default simple

    Add a global gitignore file (optional, but very useful if you have multiple projects):
        * Add ".gitignore_global" file to base git directory
          (Default is user docs. You can find out your base directory by typing 'cd ~')
        > git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global


Creating/Connecting to a new repo:

    To create a new local git repo:
        > git init
        * Include a README.md and .gitignore
        > git add -A
        > git commit -m "Initial commit"

    Download from an online repo for the first time:
        > git clone 'repo url'
          If you're using bitbucket or github, this link is provided for you to simply copy/paste.
		
    To upload to a online repo for the first time:
        > git remote add origin https://github.com/*AcountHere*/*ProjectNameHere*.git
        > git push -u origin master



Useful Commands:

Command Line Navigation:

    > ls
        View folders and files within current location.

    > ls -a
        Same as ls, but also lists hidden files.

    > cd *LocationHere*
        Change location to indicated directory.


Git Project Control:

    > git init
        Create new repository in given location.

    > git pull
        Pull any new changes from the cloud repository down onto your local repository.

    > git push
        Push any new changes from your local repository into the cloud repository.
        Note: Please test your changes before pushing.


Git Branching Commands:

    > git branch
        View all branches for project. Initially, you should only have a 'master'
        branch until you create additional ones.

    > git branch *BranchNameHere*
        Create a new branch with the given name.
        Note: Branch names are usually lowercase/camelcase.

    > git checkout *BranchNameHere*
        Transfer to indicated branch. All changes made will only be made to this branch.

    > git merge *BranchNameHere*
        Merges changes from indicated branch into current branch.
        IE: If you want to merge in changes from 'development' into the 'master' branch:
            * First, set your current branch as master.
            * Next, type 'git merge development'
            * Settle any merge conflicts, if any.
              Otherwise, congragulations. Development has now merged into master!

    > git branch -d *BranchNameHere*
        Delete the branch with the given name.
        Note: If trying to delete a branch with uncommited changed, you will get a warning.
            Use -D instead of -d in this case, and only do so if you're sure you want to delete the branch.


Tracking and Saving Changes:

    > git status
        View changed files within current repository.

    > gitk
        Bring up interface with details about changed files in repository.

    > git add -A
        Add all current changes to repository tracking.

    > git commit
        Commit all tracked changes to history. This essentially creates a "save point"
        in your project's history, that you can go back to at any point.

    > git reset --hard
        Reset entire branch back to last commit state. Very useful if you mess up/break something.
