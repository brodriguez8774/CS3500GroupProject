TODO information, as well as general information for intended structure of site.


TODO:

    Database:
        * Create image table with foreign keys to all food products.
            * Includes img path, alt tag.
        * Add email attribute to customers and employees
        * Add hours attribute to store table.
        * Add name attribute to store table? Is this redundant?
        * Create triggers to assert that cust_login and emp_logins are never identical

        Extra if time:
            * Possibly add "favorite foods"/"most purchased foods" and "card info" columns for customers?
            * Possibly modify customer and employee tables so that employees are an extension of customers, with extra fields?

    Pages: 
        * Populate home page.
	    * Create Menu page(s) based off of database values:
            * Coffee
            * Tea
            * Baked goods
	    * Create About Page
            * Include data from stores database.
            * Contact page. Possibly same page? Possibly seperate?
	    * Create user login page (preferably via lightbox).
	    * Create user info/settings pages, only accessible once logged in.
		- Get the menu and CSS working on the order/ pages.
		- Get the dropdown nav menu working
	
        Extra if time:
            * Create order online page.
            * Possibly have extra pages for employees, including pages for viewing of individual customer data.

    General:
        * Find and save images for all food products.
            * Probably organize folder structure the same as database structure
        * Determine pleasing colorpallete so site is not pure greyscale.
        * Implement security and sessions/cookies/serialization/etc.
