TODO:

    Database:
        
        Extra if time:
            * Possibly add "favorite foods"/"most purchased foods" and "card info" columns for customers?
            * Possibly modify customer and employee tables so that employees are an extension of customers, with extra fields?
            * If not extending, create triggers to assert that cust_login and emp_logins are never identical

    Pages: 
        * Populate home page.
	    * Create About Page
	    * Create user login page (preferably via lightbox).
	    * Create user info/settings pages, only accessible once logged in.
	
        Extra if time:
            * Create order online page.
            * Possibly have extra pages for employees, including pages for viewing of individual customer data.

    General:
