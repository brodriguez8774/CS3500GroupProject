TODO:

    Database:
        * User passwords are currently naively stored as plaintext. Need to be secured and hashed.
        
        Extra if time:
            * Possibly add "favorite foods"/"most purchased foods" and "card info" columns for customers?
            * Possibly modify customer and employee tables so that employees are an extension of customers, with extra fields?
            * Ingredient table feels like it could be handled better. Look into.

    Pages: 
	    * Create user page for logged in customers
        * Create more interesting employee login page. Perhaps allow selecting and editing of individual customer data?
	
        Extra if time:
            * Create user registration page.
            * Create order online page for logged in customers?

    General:
        * Figure out how to reference file structure based on root directory. Surely this has to be possible somehow.
            * Organize include statements into a more hierarchial type order.
              Generally try to minimize repeated includes present in every single page.
        * Implement further security/sessions/cookies/etc.
            * Implement more secure password handling once database passwords are hashed.


Directroy structure:

	: Root

		: static
			: css
                - sass
			- images
			- javascript

		: templates (include files)
			* Any php files which don't stand on their own or belong within the database folder.

        : menu
			- coffee.php
			- tea.php
			- bakery.php

		: user
			- settings.php
			- customer.php (combine with employee into 'user.php' page?)
			- employee.php (combine with customer into 'user.php' page?)

		- about.php
		- contact.php
        - error.php
        - index.php
		- order.php (WIP)
        - test.php (for development only. Not accessable by direct links.)

        : database
            : Initialization
                * All necessary files to build and construct the database from scratch
            * Any database connection handling and loading files.
